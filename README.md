Source codes made to use a TFT LCD screen on a raspberry pi.
This git is forked. Why have I forked it ? I did it to use its basic functions to draw pixels to the screen. My goal is to create a complete source to use such a screen with ANY (or almost) controller by using as few as possible libraries to make it portable.
For now the goal is far far away, but it's only a beginning, or at least a test to learn and study.
